# _ImmersiveTouch_
- ImmersiveTouch provides a satisfying haptic feedback in your VR controllers when your hands interacts with objects (meshes).
The vibrations are speed dependent which means stroking hairs/tails etc feels very nice.

# _GestureIndicator_
- If you ever used Index controllers, you may know how unreliable the finger tracking can be.
This causes all kinds of awkward issues when you try to express yourself in front of someone without looking at a mirror.
Gesture Indicator displays on the HUD which gestures you are currently doing.
The transparency & positions can be customizable to your likings!

# _DynamicPlates_
- DynamicPlates changes the nameplate behaviour such as scaling based on distance & position based on the head instead of the hip.
